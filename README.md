<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is has been inspired by the want to better understand neural networks and deep learning. The project is a registered monument classifier, which (hopefully soon) uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of registered monuments in the UK. The project is built using Python, and is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook.

The project currently access data from:
-  DataMapWales for the monuments and LIDAR data.
- Google Earth Engine for the satellite imagery.
